Microtorch is a lightweight neural network library that is built on top of NumPy. It offers a simple and intuitive API that is similar to PyTorch.
I built Microtorch to learn more about neural networks and how they work. I am still working on improving it, but I am excited to share it with the community and get feedback on how it can be made even better.
